To help the company pick the optimal location, I will collect data using foursquare api. And then for each outlet, I will query for the 
tips using tips api and check-ins using venue stats api.

I will process The outlet with the highest tips and first. And its surroundings will be explored and related data will be collected to 
match with other potential location. 

I will recommend location with the highest similarity score for the new outlet.
